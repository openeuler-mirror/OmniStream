## Introduction to the Project<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002517961778"></a>

### Overview<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002549641551"></a>

The big data features of OmniRuntime are presented in the form of plugins to improve the performance of data loading, computing, and exchange from end to end.

Data volumes generated from Internet services have been growing much faster than CPUs' computing power. The open-source big data ecosystem is also developing on a fast track. However, diversified computing engines and open source components make it difficult to improve data processing performance throughout the lifecycle. Different big data engines use their own unique tuning policies and technologies to improve performance and efficiency. Some tuning items may be applied across multiple engines, which may cause resource contention and conflicts, reducing overall computing performance.

OmniRuntime  consists of a series of features provided by Kunpeng BoostKit for Big Data in terms of application acceleration. It aims to improve the performance of end-to-end data loading, computing, and exchange through plugins, thereby improving the performance of big data analytics.

As a subfeature of OmniRuntime, OmniStream uses native code \(C/C++\) to implement Flink SQL operators to improve query performance. The Flink engine is reconstructed natively for enhanced performance.

It has been adapted to Flink 1.16.3.

### Architecture<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002549521547"></a>

The OmniStream Flink Native feature uses native code \(C/C++\) to reconstruct the logic of Flink SQL and DataStream operators, improving query performance.

- For SQL, OmniStream uses C++ and vectorized instructions to implement operators, leveraging vectorization to enhance SQL computing performance.
- For DataStream, OmniStream uses C++ and vectorized instructions to implement operators, fully leveraging the performance advantages of native code to improve performance in DataStream scenarios.

**SQL<a name="en-us_topic_0000002543922607_section6310183119441"></a>**

OmniStream uses an architecture consisting of the Java Adapter layer and the CPP Core layer.

- The Java Adapter layer is implemented in Java and is responsible for generating native execution plans and falling back to the Java runtime in unsupported scenarios.
- The CPP Core layer is implemented in C++ and is responsible for implementing operator logic and data transmission.

An SQL query submitted through SQL or Table API is parsed, and an execution plan is then generated. The Java Adapter layer obtains the execution plan, initializes related tasks in the CPP, and generates an operator chain. After the initialization process is complete, the task runs to read data from the source. After a series of operator processing operations, Sink outputs the result.

[Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0000002543922607_en-us_topic_0000002228744542_fig685102835814)  shows the architecture of OmniStream Flink SQL Native.<br>

**DataStream<a name="en-us_topic_0000002543922607_section10781121012457"></a>**

After receiving an input, the DataStream API parses it into an execution plan. The Java adapter layer parses the plan, initializes related tasks on the C++ side, and builds the corresponding operator chain. After the initialization process is complete, the task runs to read data from the source. After a series of operator processing operations, Sink outputs the result.

### Application Scenarios<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002549521541"></a>

OmniStream improves the processing performance of the Flink engine while preserving existing development practices and architectural compatibility. In large-scale real-time data analysis scenarios, it significantly enhances processing capacity and execution efficiency.

Apache Flink is an open source real-time stream processing engine. As services rapidly evolve and data volumes surge, Flink's performance bottlenecks have started to surface in certain high-load scenarios. This is particularly evident in Internet-related use cases, where Flink trails some peer offerings in terms of performance. OmniStream uses native code \(C/C++\) to implement Flink SQL operators, improving query execution efficiency. It natively reconstructs the Flink engine to enhance performance.

OmniStream supports Flink 1.16.3. It parses user-submitted SQL statements into a series of operators and executes them using native operators provided by it. These native operators replace open source Flink operators, significantly improving performance.

### Related Concepts<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002518121694"></a>

Nexmark: It is a benchmark suite designed for evaluating queries on continuous data streams. It offers fair and comprehensive performance tests for stream processing systems, serving as a tool for both optimization guidance and performance comparison.

## Constraints

OmniStream has restrictions on supported data types, operators, and state backends. Plan your tasks accordingly and avoid unsupported scenarios.

**SQL<a name="en-us_topic_0000002512242608_section9207153194615"></a>**

- OmniStream Flink Native supports the Nexmark benchmarking suite, including Nexmark data types and built-in functions.
- Supported data types: BIGINT, TIMESTAMP\(3\), and VARCHAR.
- Supported expressions: + - \* /
- Supported built-in functions: LOWER, SPLIT\_INDEX, DATE\_FORMAT, MOD, and COUNT\_CHAR.
- Supported GroupAggregate functions: SUM\(BIGINT\), COUNT\(BIGINT\), AVG \(BIGINT\), MIN\(BIGINT\), MIN\(VARCHAR\), MAX \(BIGINT\), and MAX\(VARCHAR\).
- The join key of the join operator must be of the BIGINT type, and the operation type must be Inner Join.
- The Deduplicate and Rank operators allow only Partition By BIGINT. All fields in the query table must be of the supported data type and only the ROW\_NUMBER function is supported. Partition By of Rank supports only one field of the BIGINT type. Order By of TOPN supports only one BIGINT field, whose sorting rule is DESC. Order By of TOP1 supports a maximum of two fields. The type can be BIGINT TIMESTAMP\(3\), and the sorting rule can be DESC or ASC.
- The Group By column of the Aggregate operator allows only BIGINT.
- The aggregate function of the LocalWindowAGG and GlobalWindowAGG operators is COUNT or MAX. The aggregate function of the GroupWindowAGG operator is COUNT.
- The LocalWindowAGG and GlobalWindowAGG operators support only the TUMBLE and HOP windows.
- The GroupWindowAGG operator supports only the SESSION window.
- The external table data source of the Lookup Join operator supports only CSV files.
- The state backend supports only the memory and RocksDB.
- Flink stores states in the memory state backend, and the memory usage grows over time as the volume of data increases. In comparison, OmniStream uses the columnar vectorized architecture to optimize performance. Its state storage behaves the same as the native Flink while delivering a higher processing speed and consuming the memory space faster. Therefore, the Nexmark benchmark test cases support a maximum of 50 million data records.

**DataStream<a name="en-us_topic_0000002512242608_section14862183194614"></a>**

For details, see  [Supported DataStream Operators and UDFs](en-us_topic_0000002512242732.md).

- Source and Sink support only Kafka data sources.
- These operators are supported: Map, FlatMap, GroupReduce, Filter, Source, and Sink.
- The Filter operator must be RichFilterFunction.
- The state backend supports only memory and does not support checkpoints.

### Routine Antivirus Software Check<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002520637378"></a>

Periodically scan clusters and Spark components for viruses. This protects clusters from viruses, malicious code, spyware, and malicious programs, reducing risks such as system breakdown and information leakage. Mainstream antivirus software can be recommended for antivirus check.

### Log Control<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002551637367"></a>

- Check whether the system can limit the size of a single log file.
- Check whether there is a mechanism for clearing logs when the log space is used up.

### Vulnerability Fixing<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002520477388"></a>

To ensure the security of the production environment and reduce the risk of attacks, enable the firewall and periodically fix the following vulnerabilities:

- OS vulnerabilities
- JDK vulnerabilities
- Hadoop and Spark vulnerabilities
- ZooKeeper vulnerabilities
- Kerberos vulnerabilities
- OpenSSL vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities in other components

    The following uses CVE-2021-37137 as an example.

    Vulnerability description:

    Netty 4.1.17 has two Content-Length HTTP headers that may be confused. The vulnerability ID is CVE-2021-37137.

    The system uses the hdfs-ceph \(version 3.2.0\) service as the storage object with decoupled storage and compute. This service depends on  **aws-java-sdk-bundle-1.11.375.jar**  and involves this vulnerability. You are advised to update the vulnerability patch in a timely manner to prevent hacker attacks.

    Impact:

    Netty 4.1.68 and earlier versions

    Handling suggestion:

    Currently, the vendor has released an upgrade patch to fix the vulnerability. For details, visit  [GitHub](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-9vjp-v76f-g363).

### SSH Hardening<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002551517385"></a>

During the installation and deployment, you need to connect to the server through SSH. The  **root**  user has all the operation permissions. Logging in to the server as the  **root**  user may pose security risks. You are advised to log in to the server as a common user for installation and deployment and disable  **root**  user login using SSH to improve system security. 

Check the  **PermitRootLogin**  configuration item in  **/etc/ssh/sshd\_config**.

- If the value is  no,  **root**  user login using SSH is disabled.
- If the value is  yes, change it to  no.
